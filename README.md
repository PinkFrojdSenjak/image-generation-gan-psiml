# Image generation using GANs

The goal of the project was to examine whether incorporating attention mechanism in GAN architecture can improve image quality. Several models were tested for this task:

<ol>
<li>Classic DCGAN </li>
<li>DCGAN with attention mechanism</li>
<li> Pretrained Progressive GAN </li>
<li>Classic DCGAN </li>
<li> "SWINGAN" </li>
</ol>
